### The Story
As a budding writer, the first step up the ladder of recognition is to produce content and in turn, garner an audience.
Thus, as a method of honing my craft and attracting engagement in the process, this blog is the door to my proprietorial world, opening just a crack, beckoning the readers to dissect the litany of literary corpses that litter my private quarters.
